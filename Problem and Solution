Objective:
Developed an SSRS-based detailed table report to analyze Options IPV performance, incorporating Skew breakdowns, P&L, FO (Front Office) values, and Nymex volumes,
enabling granular review by location and trading desk.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Problem Statement:
The IPV control team required a location-specific view of skew-based option valuation. Existing tools lacked clarity and flexibility, forcing users to shift through static spreadsheets. 
This hampered efficiency during daily price validation and skew analysis across regional teams.

ðŸš€ Solution / Actions Taken:

â€¢	âœ… SSRS Table Report: Created a table-based SSRS report with:
o	Drill-down functionality for desk â†’ instrument â†’ skew
o	Row groupings to logically separate each product and skew tier
â€¢	âœ… Data Points Included:
o	IPV vs FO P&L Delta
o	Nymex Volume
o	FO Prices
o	IPV Curve Shift Indicators
â€¢	âœ… Drill-Down & Row Grouping:
o	Users could expand/collapse skew groups for quick access to summaries or deep dives
o	Grouped by location (Houston, Singapore, London), skew type, and instrument
â€¢	âœ… Dynamic Parameters:
o	Filters for location, trading book, valuation date, and product type
â€¢	âœ… Performance Tuning:
o	Used indexed views and partitioned tables to ensure sub-second rendering for large datasets
â€¢	âœ… Scheduling & Delivery:
o	Auto-delivered to regional stakeholders via SSRS subscriptions
